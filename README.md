- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @al337a
-  Iâ€™m trying to build a SaaS startup, which is keeping me busy since Q3 2022. What's happening for Q3 2023?
-  Market Research (Value Proposition) 
-  Evaluating stacks (Altough I'm not a technical founder, I'd still want to understand how the application should/ can be built)
-  *Originally I started out wanting to make a web application, with a Ruby on Rails foundation.*
-  Gathering potential user base (interviewees)
-  I'd like to document any kind of progress here on GitHub, because its currently my only way (kind of) to speak my ideas to the outer world.
