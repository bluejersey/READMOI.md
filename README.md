- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cereallkiller (as in Froot Loops)
-  Iâ€™m building a SaaS startup which is about innovating board meeting software. (Within the Dutch governance fr example, these sorts of platforms are highly used)
-  Other categories are Document Management Sytem (DMS), Information management
-  Market research is currently on top of my to-do list. By doing market research, you will see that platforms in this industry are pretty much offering the same things, but with  a different price, different look. Working on changing this.
