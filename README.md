- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cereallkiller (as in Froot Loops)
-  Iâ€™m building a SaaS product which is about innovating board meeting software. 
-  Other categories are Document Management System (DMS), Information management
-  Market research is currently on top of my to-do list. By doing market research, you will see that all platforms in this industry are pretty much offering the same things, but with  a different price, different look. Working on changing this.
-  To built a platform like this- it is absolutely key that from where we built, is from our users, we need people that are highly efficient in the way they work, would like to improve towards the challenges they face and have almost an obsession for understanding *people* and their needs.
